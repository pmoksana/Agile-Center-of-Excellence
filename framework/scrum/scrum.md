# 🛡️ The Scrum Framework: A Complete Overview

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

---

## 🏗️ The 3-5-3 Structure
Scrum is defined by its specific roles, events, and artifacts.

### 👥 3 Roles (The Scrum Team)
The Scrum Team is the basic unit of Scrum. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
1. **Product Owner:** Accountable for maximizing value.
2. **Scrum Master:** Accountable for team effectiveness and Scrum adoption.
3. **Developers:** Accountable for creating the usable Increment.



---

### 🗓️ 5 Events
Events are used to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
1. **The Sprint:** The container for all other events (1 month or less).
2. **Sprint Planning:** Why is this Sprint valuable? What can be Done? How will it be done?
3. **Daily Scrum:** 15-minute inspection of progress toward the Sprint Goal.
4. **Sprint Review:** Inspection of the Sprint outcome and adaptation of the Backlog.
5. **Sprint Retrospective:** Inspection of how the last Sprint went regarding people, processes, and tools.

### 📦 3 Artifacts & Commitments
Artifacts represent work or value. Each artifact contains a **Commitment** to provide transparency.

| Artifact | Commitment | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Backlog** | **Product Goal** | The long-term target for the Scrum Team. |
| **Sprint Backlog** | **Sprint Goal** | The "Why" of the current Sprint. |
| **Increment** | **Definition of Done** | The quality standard the product must meet. |

---

## 🏛️ The Foundation: Pillars & Values
Scrum is based on **Empiricism** (making decisions based on what is observed).

### The 3 Pillars of Empiricism
* **Transparency:** The work must be visible to those performing it and receiving it.
* **Inspection:** Frequent checks on artifacts and progress toward goals.
* **Adaptation:** Adjusting the process if deviations occur.

### The 5 Scrum Values
Success depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values:
**Courage | Focus | Commitment | Respect | Openness**
