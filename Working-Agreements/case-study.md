# Case Study: Transitioning a Distributed SAFe Squad from Storming to Performing

## 1. Context & Initial State (The "Storming" Stage)

During the kickoff of a new **Agile Release Train (ART)** delivering an enterprise B2B2C analytics platform, a newly formed squad was struggling with severe operational friction. 
The team was distributed across three time zones and composed of distinct functional disciplines: **Developers, Data Analysts, a Product Owner (PO), and a System Architect**.

### Observed Anti-Patterns & Bottlenecks
* **Misaligned Priorities:** The Product Owner pushed for 100% feature velocity, while the System Architect frequently injected unrefined architectural enablers mid-sprint without prior estimation.
* **Handoff Friction & Blocked Pipeline:** Developers built web/mobile UI components, but features sat in "Blocked" status for days waiting for Data Analysts to validate backend ETL schemas and payload contracts.
* **Communication Breakdown:** Distributed team members communicated via ad-hoc private messages, leading to duplicated effort and lack of visibility on dependency status.
* **Meeting Fatigue & Status Reporting:** Daily Standups (DSUs) turned into 30-minute status meetings where developers reported to the Scrum Master rather than synchronizing with each other.

## 2. The Intervention: Co-Creating the Team Working Agreement

During the **Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration** Retrospective, as a Scrum Master I facilitated a dedicated 60-minute workshop using the **Liberating Structure 1-2-4-All** to establish a living Team Working Agreement.

Rather than imposing rules top-down, I coached the team to identify their core pain points and co-create four foundational agreement pillars:
