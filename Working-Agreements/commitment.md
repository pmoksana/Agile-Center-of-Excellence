# 🤝  Engineering: Team Working Agreements

> **Our Social Contract:** Moving from unstated assumptions to explicit alignment for high-performing collaboration.

## 🧭 What are Working Agreements?
Working agreements are a great tool to improve collaboration and be more productive.
These are are guidelines, rules, or behaviors the team has agreed on. 
We agreed on what we want to do together with the whole team and make sure everyone is able to keep the agreements, our team will work together with less friction and be happier.
For the dev team to work effectively and achieve their goals, we needed to decide on the ways of working and behaviors we want to follow to shared sense of responsibility, make it easier to identify and discuss both positive and negative behavior, empower the leader to keep the team accountable, and enhance the team's productivity.


At our company, working agreements describe exactly how we commit to interacting. They are not top-down mandates; they are behaviors we have collectively agreed to follow to reduce friction and improve our daily flow.

Depending on the context, these are our "Rules of Engagement" or "Team Norms."

## 🚀 Why We Document Our Standards
Individual expectations rarely match by default. By formalizing these norms, we:
* **Foster Shared Accountability:** Everyone knows the "rules," making it easier to discuss behavior.
* **Empower Leadership:** It gives leads a neutral baseline to keep the team on track.
* **Boost Productivity:** We spend less time wondering "how" to work and more time doing it.

## 🧱 What We Include in Our Agreements
We start our agreements with the phrase: *"As a team, we agree to..."*

### 📡 General Collaboration
* **Ask for Help:** We flag blockers early rather than struggling in silence.
* **Radical Candor:** We provide honest, constructive feedback during retros and reviews.
* **Punctuality:** We respect each other's time by joining ceremonies on time.
* **WIP Limits:** We focus on finishing over starting—maximum 4 active stories at a time.

### 🏗 Version Control
* **No Direct Pushing:** All changes go through a Pull Request; never commit to `main`.
* **The 24-Hour Rule:** We aim to review PRs within one business day.
* **Clean Merges:** Only merge when all CI checks pass and at least one peer has approved.
* **Done Means Done:** Automated tests are included, staging is verified, and documentation is updated.

### 🚀 "Definition of done"

* **The change has sufficient automated tests.
* **Changes have been tested on the staging environment.
* **Code has been peer-reviewed.
* **All continuous integration (CI) checks pass.
* **Code is merged to the main branch and successfully deployed.
* **Relevant documentation is updated.
* **Task goal (acceptance criteria) is met.

## 🛠 How We Create Them (Workshop Guide)

### 1. The Session
We set aside 60–90 minutes for a dedicated session. Total team participation is required to ensure 100% buy-in.

### 2. The Process
* **Brainstorm:** Use a Miro board for 10 minutes of silent ideation on what helps or hinders your work.
* **Group:** The facilitator clusters similar ideas into "themes."
* **Vote:** We prioritize the 5–10 items that will have the biggest impact.
* **Refine:** We ensure every agreement is clear, actionable, and measurable.

### 3. The "Fist of Five" Consensus
We don't move forward with a rule unless everyone can support it. If a team member holds up 1 or 2 fingers, we re-word the agreement until it reaches a 3 or higher.

## 💡 Best Practices for Success

### Keep it Living
A working agreement is not a "set and forget" document. 
* **Retrospectives:** Review these agreements regularly. If a rule isn't being followed, either fix the behavior or remove the rule.
* **Onboarding:** Walk every new hire through this document so they understand our "DNA" from day one.
* **Propose Changes:** Anyone can suggest an update. Simply tag the Team Lead or Scrum Master in a comment on this document.

### Automate the Enforcement
The best way to make these stick is to remove the "human" element where possible:
* **Linting/Formatting:** Use Prettier or Black to automate code style so we don't argue about it in PRs.
* **GitHub Actions:** Use branch protection and CI pipelines to enforce our technical agreements automatically.
* **Checklists:** Use GitHub PR templates to provide a "Definition of Done" checklist for every task.

* / Sometimes this document is referred to as a "team contract" or "team agreement" and the listed working agreements as "team standards," "rules of engagement," "ground rules," "team norms," "team rules," or "collaboration guidelines."
