# 📈 KPI & Delivery Performance Report
> **Demonstrating data-driven leadership and process optimization.**

This report outlines the key metrics tracked across multidisciplinary data initiatives to ensure transparency, quality, and high ROI.

---

## 🚀 1. Delivery Velocity & Efficiency
I track these metrics to ensure the engineering team (Data Engineers & Modellers) is operating at peak efficiency.

* **Cycle Time Reduction:** Reduced the average time from "Data Request" to "Production Deployment" by **25%** through the implementation of CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.
* **Sprint Velocity Stability:** Achieved a **90% Say/Do ratio** over 6 months by improving backlog grooming and "Definition of Ready" standards.
* **Deployment Frequency:** Increased from bi-weekly to **on-demand (Daily)** by automating regression testing for SQL models.

## 💎 2. Data Quality & Governance KPIs
As a Data PM, I treat "Data Quality" as a primary delivery metric.

* **Data Accuracy:** Maintained **99.9% data accuracy** in the "Gold" layer by implementing automated validation gates in Azure Data Factory.
* **Schema Drift Detection:** Reduced pipeline downtime by **40%** through automated alerts that notify the team of upstream source changes before they break the ETL.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** 100% success rate in monthly GDPR/PII audits via automated Unity Catalog tagging.

## 🧪 3. Process Improvement "Experiments"
I follow a "Facilitator" style that encourages small experiments to uplift team performance.

| Experiment | Hypothesis | Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pair Modeling** | Pairing a Data Engineer with an Analyst for Star Schema design. | **50% fewer bugs** found in UAT phase. | **Adopted** |
| **Mock Data Testing** | Providing synthetic data for Analysts while pipelines are built. | Analytics team started work **3 days earlier** in the Sprint. | **Adopted** |
| **Async Retros** | Using an anonymous board for feedback before the live meeting. | **30% increase** in constructive process feedback. | **Adopted** |

## 💰 4. Business Value & ROI
* **Cost Optimization:** Identified and removed redundant Databricks clusters, saving the client **£15k/month** in Azure consumption costs.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Achieved an average score of **4.8/5** in end-of-quarter business reviews for transparency and reporting clarity.
