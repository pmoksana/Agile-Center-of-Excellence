# Hybrid-Agile Delivery Framework
### My Facilitator Style
* **Why & How:** I don't just track tickets; I facilitate "Discovery Sprints" where Data Engineers and Business Analysts define the **Definition of Done (DoD)** to ensure technical work meets business needs.
* **Sprint Structure:** 2-week Sprints focused on engineering velocity, paired with monthly **Steering Committee** updates for executive alignment.
* **The Retrospective:** I use "Safe Space" techniques to ensure engineers can discuss technical debt honestly, preventing project bottlenecks.
