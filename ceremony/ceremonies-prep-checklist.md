## 🎯 The Philosophy of High-Value Ceremonies
We don't meet to "status update"—we meet to **align, unblock, and decide**. Success in our ceremonies is determined by what happens *before* the meeting starts.
To maximize the value of Scrum events, preparation must happen *before* the timebox begins. 

  Use this checklist to ensure you have the right artifacts and mindset ready.

## 🛠 Facilitator’s "Golden Rules"
1. **No Agenda, No Meeting:** If the purpose isn't clear in the invite, decline it.
2. **Timebox Rigorously:** Use a timer. Respect the "2-minute transition" rule.
3. **Document Decisions:** Post the "Key Takeaways" in the team Slack channel immediately after.
4. **Link to Data:** Refer to the [**Metrics & Visualization Page**](./metrics.md) to ground discussions in reality.

## 💡 Pro-Tips 
* **The "Room" Check:** If remote, ensure all links are in the calendar invite 5 minutes before. If physical, ensure there are enough markers and post-its.
* **The "Vibe" Check:** Bring a "check-in" question to break the ice (e.g., "In one word, how was your weekend?").
* **The "Outcome" Check:** Never leave a ceremony without clearly defined next steps or owners for action items.
