**What to Bring:**
* **The Team:** Updates on their progress and knowledge of any new blockers.

* **Tools:**
    * **The Sprint Board:** Visualized (screen share or physical board).
    * **The Burndown Chart:** To see if the team is on track mid-sprint.
    * **Timer:** To ensure the event stays strictly under 15 minutes.

## 🔍 Sprint Review
**Objective:** Inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog.

**What to Bring:**

    * Environment where the product can be demonstrated live.

## 🔄 Sprint Retrospective
**Objective:** Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

**What to Bring:**
* **Everyone:** An open mind and commitment to the "Prime Directive" (believing everyone did their best).
* **Scrum Master:** Data on cycle time, escaped defects, or team morale trends.
* **Tools:**
    * **Facilitation Format:** (e.g., Start/Stop/Continue, Sailboat, or 4Ls).
    * **Whiteboard:** (Miro, Mural, or physical) for capturing action items.
    * **Previous Action Items:** To check if the team actually improved from the last session.

---

## 💡 Pro-Tips 
* **The "Room" Check:** If remote, ensure all links are in the calendar invite 5 minutes before. If physical, ensure there are enough markers and post-its.
* **The "Vibe" Check:** Bring a "check-in" question to break the ice (e.g., "In one word, how was your weekend?").
* **The "Outcome" Check:** Never leave a ceremony without clearly defined next steps or owners for action items.
